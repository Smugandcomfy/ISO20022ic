# ISO20022/Swift message types, processes and samples

IC4J tool generated a version of #ISO20022  compatible #ICP Motoko types, available on this Github repository:  [https://github.com/dscope-io/ISO20022/tree/master/messages/Motoko]()
Currently, we cover the full Payments part of the specification (ACMT, ADMI, AUTH, CAMT, PACS, PAIN, REDA, REMT) as defined in the #ISO20022 standard: [https://iso20022.org/iso-20022-message-definitions?business-domain=1]()
We plan to add more parts of the specifications and provide samples for writing #ICP smart contracts using the generated message types. Additionally, we might generate message types for other languages used in smart contracts, such as Rust, Python, and Typescript, in the future.
