# ISO20022/Swift message types, processes and samples

IC4J tool generated an early version of #ISO20022  compatible #ICP Motoko types, available on this Github repository:  [https://github.com/dscope-io/ISO20022/tree/master/messages/Motoko]()
Currently, we cover the PACS and PAIN parts of the specification. PACS (Payments Clearing and Settlement) denotes XML messages used between banks and PAIN (Payments Initiation) denotes XML messages used between customer and bank, as defined in the #ISO20022 standard: [https://iso20022.org/iso-20022-message-definitions?business-domain=1]()
We plan to add more parts of the specifications and provide samples for writing #ICP smart contracts using the generated message types. Additionally, we might generate message types for other languages used in smart contracts, such as Rust, Python, and Typescript, in the future.
